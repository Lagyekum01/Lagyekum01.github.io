            <article
                         <p>My name is Livia Agyekum and I am absolutely obsessed with beauty and fashion! The combination of my love for fashion and writing has led me to purse a career in online media with an interest in social media. I am a student at the University of Florida where I am currently majoring in journalism.In addition to blogging about beauty and fashion in my spare time, I also love to create makeup tutorials to feature on my YouTube channel.  I believe my passion for fashion is a trait I inherited from my grandmother. She was a self-made seamstress and clothing designer in her native country of Ghana in West Africa. It is from her that I learned to trust my inner Fashionista and embrace my originality and personal style.
